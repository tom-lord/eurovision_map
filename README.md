eurovision_map
==============

A graphical analysis of Eurovision voting patterns

Using the JQVMap framework (http://jqvmap.com/), eurovision_map.html contains an interactive map of Europe.
Clicking on a country shows the results of their votes in the 2014 eurovision song contest.


This is currently very much under development, and I'll update this readme as features get added.
